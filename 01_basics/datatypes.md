# Data Types in python

## Object Types / Data Types

- Number: `1234`, `12.34`, `3+4j`, `0b111`, `Decimal()`, `Fraction()`
- String: `'spam'`, `"Saman"`, `b'a\x01c'`, `u'sp\xc4m'`
- List: [1], [2, 'three']

#### Hitesh Sir notes for more information

-- The garbage collection of numbers and strings is not done immediately because they are widely used data types so python keeps them for sometime to check if they are referenced again, like why would you want to create and assign the memory space again if you already had one in the past
